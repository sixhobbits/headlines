# Headlines

This is the first example project from my book Flask By Example (https://flaskbyexample.com)

This project focuses on:
* Creating a basic Flask app
* Fetching and consolidating data from various APIs
* Dealing with user input
* Adding cookies in Flask
* Custom CSS

Note that the focus is on education and building things from scratch instead of using blindly using pre-existing frameworks. This code should not be taken as an example of production-ready code.
